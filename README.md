# Emby Sync - Pyhton

I created this project because while Emby already has an amazing sync system, it works best (and after recent changes will only work) when the device running the sync has emby installed. My use-case is to sync media only a removable USB stick.
So I created this script that runs from the command line and does everything its self.
